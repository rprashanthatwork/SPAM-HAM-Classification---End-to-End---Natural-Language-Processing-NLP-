# SPAM-HAM-Classification---End-to-End---Natural-Language-Processing-NLP-
End to End guide to learn everything you need to know in NLP

## 1. Objective
To build a prediction model that will accurately classify which texts are spam?

## 2. Problem and Data
2.1. Data
Collection of SMS messages tagged as spam or legitimate https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset

2.2. Description of the variables
The file contains one message per line. Each line is composed of 2 columns:

type: Label (ham or spam)
text: The plain text

2.3. Machine learning problem
The purpose of the analysis is to build a model to predict whether the SMS is spam or not,  This is a end-to-end guide to learn the text preprocessing and various processes involved in Natural language Processing, like:

## 3  Importing data and cleaning
3.1  Importing Libraries
3.2  Statistical summary
## 4  Descriptive analysis
4.1  Percentage of Spam/Ham
4.2  Top spam/ham messages
4.3  Individual Spam/ham words
4.4  Spam and Ham Word cloud
4.5  Top 10 Spam and Ham Words
4.6  Basic feature extraction from text data
4.7  Length of message
## 5  Manipulation of textual data
5.1  Text Transformation - cleaning data by removing **punctuations/ stopwords and stemming words**
5.2  Text Analytics - Plotting most frequent words in Spam/non-spam messages
5.3  TFIDF Vectorizer
## 6  MODEL APPLICATION
6.1  SVM
6.2  Multinomial Naive Bayes
6.3  Decision Tree
6.4  Logistic Regression
6.5  Random Forest
6.6  AdaBoost
6.7  XGBoost
## 7  Comparison Between Models
7.1  Accuracy and F1 Score
7.2  Confusion Matrices
7.3  Misclassified samples from SVM
## 8  Parameter Tuning using GridSearchCV -to tune the parameters of top performing classifier
